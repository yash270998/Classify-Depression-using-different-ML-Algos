# Classify-Depression-using-different-ML-Algos

The folder contains two methods.

In the root folder, there are two files test.py and encoding.py
They use the scores.csv and are based on the the decision tree classifier 
General statistical values are used in this case i.e the 95th,90th percentiles,
median, deviation, variance etc.


Method 1 folder contains 4 scripts.
preprocess.py handles the dataset and preprocesses them and stores them in 4 files.
tree.py, svm.py and nnclassifier are the three files to handle accuracy.
visualize.py puts the preprocessed data on a graph.


Method 2 folder contains another method of preprocessing the data.
It contains decision tree and svm classifier as well. Additionally, it contains a 
script that runs lstm classifier as well.
